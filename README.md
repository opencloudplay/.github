# OpenCloudPlay README.md

Welcome to OpenCloudPlay, an open-source initiative designed to help the way we game by leveraging the power of cloud computing. Our mission is to make high-quality gaming accessible to everyone, everywhere, without the need for expensive, high-end local hardware. By utilizing cloud infrastructure, OpenCloudPlay aims to create a seamless, high-performance gaming experience that can be streamed to any device.

## Goal

The primary goal of OpenCloudPlay is to develop cloud-agnostic infrastructure setups for cloud gaming. We're starting with major cloud providers to lay down the foundation and plan to expand to other local vendors, allowing for greater flexibility and choice for gamers worldwide. Ultimately, we aim to collaborate with market players to offer cloud locations in closer proximity to gamers, significantly reducing latency and enhancing the gaming experience.

## Features

- **Cloud-Agnostic Framework:** Build setups that can be deployed across different cloud services, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
- **Minimal Latency:** Optimize infrastructure to ensure games are streamed with the lowest possible latency.
- **Scalable and Cost-Effective:** Design solutions that are not only scalable to handle different loads but also cost-effective, making cloud gaming more accessible.
- **Community-Driven:** Leverage the knowledge and skills of a global community of engineers, gamers, and enthusiasts to drive innovation and improvements.
